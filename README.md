My first project in the Intermediate Java Class.

The Goal of the project is to write a simple java program that accepts input from the user, 
perform some calculations, and then generates output. The program simulates placing an order at a store. 
* Prompt for customer information.   
* Prompt for a product.   
* Prompt for a product quantity.  
* Prompt user if they want to add additional products.   
* After all products and their quantities have been entered display a receipt.

I've also included the documentation I've been givin for the project and will later include my deliverables.

## TODO
* Actually complete project
* Add Deliverables
