My first project in the Intermediate Java Class.

The Goal of the project is to write a simple java program that accepts input from the user, 
perform some calculations, and then generates output. The program simulates placing an order at a store. 
* Prompt for customer information.   
* Prompt for a product.   
* Prompt for a product quantity.  
* Prompt user if they want to add additional products.   
* After all products and their quantities have been entered display a receipt.

I've also included the documentation I've been givin for the project and will later include my deliverables.

## Given Documentation
* Project1_CIS304.pdf - Outlines the scope of the project.   
* Example_ClassDiagram.pdf - Outlines the recommended java class structure with methods.   
* Example_ProjectSource.pdf - An example of the paper deliverable. We're basically expected to just replace "Homer Simpson" with our information.   

### TODO
* Actually complete project
* Add Deliverables
